# Research Papers — Preprints Archive

This repository stores the PDF files of my published research papers. The preprints/ folder is reserved strictly for final published-paper PDFs only — no citations, no drafts, no supplementary files, and no other file types.

## Repository layout
- preprints/ — only final published-paper PDFs (see naming rules).
- README.md — this file.

## File and naming rules (required)
- Only upload the final published paper PDF into `preprints/`.
- Filename format (required): `YYYY-shortname.pdf`
  - Use four-digit year, a short hyphen-separated lowercase shortname, and the .pdf extension.
  - Example: `2025-efficient-transformers.pdf`
